# Git Init

the `git init` commd is used to create an empty git repository

if you wanted to create a new directory and initalize a git repository, you can do so with the following commands:
```
mkdir NewDirectory
cd NewDirectory
git init
```

once inside a git repository, you can start using commands such as
[status](./status.md),
[add](./add.md),
[commit](./commit.md),
[push](./push.md) and more.

init will create the repositiory in the current directory and will encapsulate all content, including other directories.
